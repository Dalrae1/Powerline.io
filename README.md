Powerline.io server emulator made in Node.js, as well as the client implementation for a server selector

This is still in development, and as such does include some odd bugs.

This will emulate all of Powerline.io's game functionality that is in the main server, as well as various fixes ralated to known bugs in the main server.

Known bugs that are fixed:
- U-turn when server lags
- ping is taken into account with all moves, which will fix most lag-related issues
